# Coastal Services: Brand Identity & Voice Guidelines

**Mission**: To provide an "Elite" permanent lighting experience that feels engineered, not just "installed."

## 1. The Voice: "Engineered Luxury"

Our documentation and UI copy should never sound generic. We are not selling "lights"; we are selling "Architecture in Motion."

| Don't Say | Do Say (The Coastal Way) |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| "Turn on the lights" | "Activate the environment" |
| "It connects to WiFi" | "Fleet synchronization active" |
| "Check if it's broken" | "Run Diagnostic Triage" |
| "Password" | "Golden Key" |
| "Schedule" | "Nature-Sync" |

## 2. Typography & Formatting

- **Font**: Inter / Outfit (Modern, Clean, Sans-Serif).
- **Headers**: Always use clear, bold headers.
- **Alerts**: Use "Callout Blocks" (Tip, Important, caution) generously to guide the user's eye.
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace. Never clutter the page.

## 3. Visual Language

- **Primary Color**: `#D4AF37` (Coastal Gold) - Used for primary actions and active states.
- **Background**: `#0F172A` (Deep Navy) - The canvas for light.
- **Surface**: `#1E293B` (Slate) - For cards and containers.
- **Signal Colors**:
    - 🟢 Green: "Healthy / Verified"
    - 🟡 Yellow: "Warning / Weak Signal"
    - 🔴 Red: "Critical / Disconnected"

## 4. The "No Shortcuts" Philosophy

In every manual and screen:
- **Depth**: Explain *why*, not just *how*. (e.g., "We use IP66 enclosures to prevent salt corrosion," not just "Use this box.")
- **Precision**: Use exact units (Amps, Volts, RSSI dBm).
- **Ownership**: Address the user as an "Owner" or "Partner," not a "User."

*Use these guidelines for all future manuals, app screens, and installer communications.*
